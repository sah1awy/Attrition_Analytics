# HR KPIs for Workforce Management

## 1. Employee Count
- **Challenge**: The HR department lacks visibility into the total number of employees, making it challenging to assess workforce size and plan for future growth or downsizing effectively.
- **KPI**: Total Employee Count
- **Purpose**: Provides a clear view of the organization's current workforce size, enabling better workforce planning and resource allocation.

## 2. Attrition Count
- **Challenge**: The organization lacks a standardized method to track employee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organization.
- **KPI**: Total Attrition Count
- **Purpose**: Tracks the total number of employees who have left, allowing HR to monitor workforce stability and investigate reasons for attrition.

## 3. Attrition Rate
- **Challenge**: Without a clear measure of attrition rate, the organization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarks, hindering the ability to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement.
- **KPI**: Attrition Rate
- **Formula**: `(Number of employees who left / Total number of employees) * 100`
- **Purpose**: Provides insight into employee turnover and helps compare against industry standards for improved retention strategies.

## 4. Active Employees
- **Challenge**: The organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing the current workforce's productivity and capacity.
- **KPI**: Active Employee Count
- **Purpose**: Clearly defines the number of employees actively contributing to the organization, supporting workforce capacity management and productivity assessments.

## 5. Average Age
- **Challenge**: The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees, making it difficult to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and retain younger talent.
- **KPI**: Average Employee Age
- **Formula**: `Sum of employee ages / Total number of employees`
- **Purpose**: Provides a demographic overview that can be used for succession planning and initiatives to attract a balanced workforce age distribution.
